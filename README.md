The My-Azure-OpenAi project integrates Azure OpenAI services into a web application to facilitate user interactions through natural language processing. It leverages ASP.NET Core for backend development and SQL Server for data storage. The application allows users to interact with an AI-powered chatbot, which generates responses based on user input. Conversations are persisted in the SQL Server database, enabling seamless continuity across sessions. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing OpenAI's powerful natural language capabilities.
